## **Structure of repo**
This repo is divided by the two overarching processes in relation to the development of the QA-systems.
The process are as follows:

### **Dataset generation**
The process of developing and evaluating the QA-pairs based on the webscraped data from Beoworld. The files is split between abstractive summarization and two-step approach
### **Retreival Augmented Generation**
This folder encompasses the development and usage of the RAG systems. It develops the vector database, saved as the storage folder. 
It allows for inference based on the RAG system with either the fine-tuned or baseline model. Additionally, it includes a chatbot based on one of the RAG models that can be run from the terminal.
